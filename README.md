 we have two test classes: BatteryTest and EngineTest. Each class contains multiple test methods that verify the behavior of the corresponding class.

For the Battery class, we test the charge, discharge, and full_discharge methods by asserting the expected charge level after performing the operations.

For the Engine class, we test the start_engine and stop_engine methods by checking if the engine is running or not after invoking these methods.
